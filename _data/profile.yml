  <p>
  I'm <strong>李 盛忻</strong> (Shengxin Li, リー&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;シュヨン シン), a 4th year bachelor student at <a href="https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn">School of Information Science and Technology</a>, <a href="https://shanghaitech.edu.cn">ShanghaiTech University</a>, 
  majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> while minoring in <strong>Interaction Design</strong>. 
  I'm currently an undergraduate research assistant at <a href="https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liquan/">ViSeer Lab</a>, 
  under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/liquan/">Prof. Quan Li</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  My research interests lie in the field of <strong>Human-Computer Interaction</strong> (HCI). 
  I'm interested to design and implement exciting techniques and products for people's well-being. 
  Currently, I have participated in multiple research projects at ViSeer Lab. 
  These diverse projects laid my foundation for future HCI research.
  </p>
  <p>
  I'm passionate to make my own contribution for the HCI community. 
  However, I have been persistently struggling with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder">ADHD</a>. 
  However, there still exists gap on providing better support for Adult ADHD patients from a HCI perspective. 
  Therefore, I will lead my new research project on exploring approaches supporting us ADHDers, and <strong>I'm expected to conduct future research on this issue</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <em><strong>I'm actively seeking for Master's positions in 25Fall!</strong></em>
  </p>
  <p>
  During my free time, I enjoy travelling and photography. 
  I'm also a big fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sakanactionchannel">サカナクション</a>. I deeply resonate with their songs.
