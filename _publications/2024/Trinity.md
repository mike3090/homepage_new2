abstract: >-
    Academic Oral Presentation allows students to express ideas and present research findings. However, students often face the challenge of integrating verbal, nonverbal and visual elements into the presentation.<br>
    Based on a need-finding survey, a design study and an expert interview, we proposed <em>Trinity</em>, a hybrid delivery support system that provides guidance for multichannel delivery on-the-fly.<br>
    We conducted a controlled between-subject user study to investigate the usability, effectiveness, interaction, influence, trust and collaboration of <em>Trinity</em>.
