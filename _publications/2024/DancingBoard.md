abstract: >-
    Motion Comic, a form of animation that appropriates an existing comic book into a screen-based animated narrative, proposes challenges for amateur creators as they lack proficiency with professional creation tools.<br>
    We conducted (1) a formative study to identify challenges faced by amateurs and (2) a review of the Motion Comics design space. Based on these results, we developed <em>DancingBoard</em>, an integrated authoring tool streamlines motion comic creation for amateur creators.<br>
    We evaluated <em>DancingBoard</em>’s usability and the outcome’s efficiency in conveying the story through two user studies and semi-structured interviews.
