abstract: >-
    Interaction techniques in virtual environments (such as Mixed Reality) necessitate <u>Gaze-Hand Alignment</u>, which requires gaze fixation and hand selection on the same target at the same time. However, people's gaze-hand behaviour in real world is often <u>unaligned</u>.<br>
    We proposed <strong>UPinch</strong>, a gaze-hand based selection technique that adapts the inherent gaze-hand coordination observed in human reach-to-grasp process to 3D environments.<br>
    We conducted a series of cross-reality experiments comparing UPinch to Gaze + Pinch, Gaze + Handray and Reality, identifying their gaze-hand characteristics in diverse tasks.
